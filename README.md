# making-maybes
It's my first repository! Maybe I want to do this and maybe I don't . . . I'm just making maybes. 

Hey all! It's me, Ashley, and I'm currently attempting to figure out how to use GitHub. 

I've decided that 2016 will be the year I finally learn to code and develop fluently. I've always wanted to learn, but never took the time to actually focus on it. Well, this year, I will procrastinate no more! Ummm... scratch that, let me try again. This year, I will procrastinate less! There we go! Much better :-)

Making Maybes sounds a lot like Making Babies. I assure you, that was NOT my intention when I first wrote it down. I realized the connection after I read it out loud and it made me laugh, so I'm keeping it. I've already made three babies, I'm all set with making any more. But making maybes . . . that's something I'm interested in. I've got a bunch of ideas that I can clearly envision in my mind, I just need to figure out how to get from here to there. I plan to use Making Maybes as my testing grounds and as a catchall for my ideas. 

Well, that's pretty much it. I'm sure I will need plenty of assistance from people who actually know what they're doing once I start a project, so stick around. 

Let's make maybes together! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
